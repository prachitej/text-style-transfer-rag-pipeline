# Text Style Transfer with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for text style transfer applications, combining retrieval of relevant information with neural style transfer techniques.

## Features

- **RAG Pipeline**: Enhances text generation with external knowledge retrieval
- **Style Transfer**: Transforms text into desired writing styles
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines BM25 and vector-based retrieval methods
- **LLM Integration**: Works with Hugging Face language models
